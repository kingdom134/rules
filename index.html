<p class="lead">3.2. An ally's hive or hives that are formed on its territory may not be attacked.</p>
<p class="lead">3.3. Hives which are formed on neutral territory may be attacked at any time. That is why it is recommended to join a major alliance or to merge with other alliances in neutral territories to pretend to hold a major castle that would be available.</p>
<p class="lead">3.4. When an alliance migrates its hive to another territory it cannot be attacked for 3 days.</p>
<hr class="my-4">

<h2>4. Isolated castles</h2>
<p class="lead">4.1. An isolated castle can be attacked all the time.</p>

<p>PO is the person in charge of allocating buffs to the players.</p>
<p>PO announces that it is available by writing "PO on" and that it is no longer available by writing "PO off".</p>
<p>You can only request a buff when PO is available.</p>
<p>The system operates according to a protocol and codification.</p>

<p>For example, before starting the construction of a building, you go to the chat group named "Buffroom" and if PO is available, you write "B+ please".</p>
<p>When PO has assigned you the buff, you will see your name scroll on the screen (as name scrolling can be out of sync, instantly after buff is assigned to you, there is a mail about it, so better watch for the new mail, you can check also your profile to verify the buff is there and correct one) and you can then start the construction of your building.</p>
<p>As soon as it is done, you return to the chat group named "Buffroom" and you write "B- done, thank you" in order to close your request.</p>

<p>It's each one's turn and it's the same protocol for requests for research and for troop training, only the codification changes.</p>
<p>The codes are:</p>
<p>1. B+ and B- for the building construction buff</p>
<p>2. R+ and R- for the research buff</p>
<p>3. T+ and T- for the troops training buff</p>
