<p class="lead">1.1. The rulers are the King who holds King's Landing and the leaders of the alliances that hold one of the seven other major castles (Storm's End, Sunspear Riverrun, Highgarden, Eyrie, Casterly Rock and Winterfell) and are therefore considered allies of the kingdom.<p>

<p class="lead">5.3. Harvesting resources on the territory of another alliance is prohibited.</p>
<p class="lead">5.4. Allies of an alliance are free to attack those who try to harvest resources on their territory.</p>
<p class="lead">5.5. Under no circumstances is it allowed to attack a harvesting unit on a harvesting site outside of the above rules.</p>
